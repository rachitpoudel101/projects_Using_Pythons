## Overview
This Python script provides a simple to-do list application where users can add tasks, view tasks, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks.

## How to Use
1. **Installation**: No installation is required. Simply download or clone the repository containing the script.

2. **Running the Application**:
    - Open a terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to the directory containing the script (`todo_list.py`).
    - Run the script by executing `python todo_list.py`.

3. **Usage**:
    - Upon running the script, you'll be presented with a menu-driven interface.
    - Choose options from the menu to add, view, mark, or remove tasks.
    - Follow the on-screen prompts to perform desired actions.

## Functionality
- **Add a Task**: Enter a task to add it to the to-do list.
- **View Tasks**: Display all tasks in the to-do list along with their indexes.

## Note
- Tasks are stored in a file (`todo_list.txt`) within the same directory as the script.
- The application loads tasks from the file upon startup and saves tasks to the file after any modification.
